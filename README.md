    <h2>Lead Me Home</h2>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Lead+Me+Home" alt="Lead Me Home Documentary">
    <p><em>Lead Me Home</em> is a short documentary that focuses on the rapidly growing crisis of homelessness in North America, specifically the United States. It focuses on individuals experiencing homelessness in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. The film uses a combination of shocking images and interviews in order to shed light on personal stories. The film does not rely on narration; the producers let the stories of those affected speak for themselves. From tent cities sprawled nearside a highway to quiet, deep moments, the documentary captures the emotional weight of homelessness while being able to highlight the systemic issues that cause it, such as the rising housing costs and lack of social support.
    Watching <em>Lead Me Home</em> was emotional and thought-provoking. The film made me see homelessness as more than just a social issue; it’s a truly personal one, affecting people in different and heartbreaking ways. I was particularly moved by the story of a woman who spoke about her fear and isolation after losing her home and being stranded on the street with her two kids. It made me realize how vulnerable people are when they lack stability, and it left me questioning how society can allow such suffering to continue. Also, a scene that stood out to me was a shot of a crowded tent city juxtaposed with luxury high-rises in the background. This contrast was a powerful reminder of the inequalities in our world. This documentary fits into my project by giving a real face and real stories to homelessness. It complements the other media I’ve chosen by showing the visual realities of what it means to lose your home. The raw honesty of the interviews and the absence of a narrator made the stories feel personal, compelling me to confront the issue head-on. It also made me question the systems in place and consider how I can help these individuals.</p>

    <h2>On the Way Home Podcast</h2>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=On+The+Way+Home+Podcast" alt="On the Way Home Podcast">
    <p>The <em>On the Way Home</em> podcast focuses on housing and homelessness, and the episode about prevention explores methods of stopping homelessness before it starts. The host and guest discuss systemic solutions like affordable housing, access to healthcare, and early interventions. They emphasize that prevention is cheaper and significantly more effective than addressing homelessness once it has already occurred. The episode provides examples of successful programs and showcases the importance of collaboration between governments, non-profits, and communities.
    Listening to this episode gave me a new perspective on homelessness. I had always thought of solutions as shelters and rehousing, but prevention makes so much sense. It’s about stopping the cycle before it begins, which feels both hopeful and logical. One example they gave was early financial assistance to families at risk of eviction. It made me wonder why governments don’t invest more in these programs. This episode is important for my project because it shifts the focus from reactive solutions to proactive ones. It connects to the theme by showing that homelessness isn’t inevitable—there are ways to prevent it if the right resources are provided. The conversational style of the podcast made the information easy to understand and relate to, which helped me think critically about my own assumptions. It also inspired me to explore how I can include prevention in my project.</p>

    <h2>The Hidden Homeless</h2>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=The+Hidden+Homeless+by+Tishani+Doshi" alt="The Hidden Homeless Poem">
    <p>Tishani Doshi’s poem <em>The Hidden Homeless</em> is a powerful piece of writing that explores the lives of people who are homeless but go unnoticed by society. The poem uses vivid imagery and metaphor to describe the emotional and physical toll of homelessness. Doshi focuses on the invisibility of these people, showing how they exist in the shadows of society. The poem doesn’t just talk about the lack of a physical home but also the loss of identity and belonging that comes with it.
    Reading this poem made me feel a mix of sadness and curiosity. The line “the sky opens like a wound” stuck with me because it perfectly captures the vulnerability of being homeless. It also made me think about how we often ignore people in these situations simply because we don’t want to see them. The poem asks readers to confront this invisibility, which really challenged me to think about my own biases. This poem connects to my project by showing the emotional and hidden side of homelessness. It contrasts with the more visible stories I’ve seen in documentaries and read about in articles, adding a deeper layer to my understanding of the topic. The poem’s style is simple but impactful, using metaphors to say more than what’s written. It’s a reminder that homelessness isn’t just about losing a home but also about losing dignity and connection. This perspective is something I want to include in my project because it’s so easy to overlook.</p>
